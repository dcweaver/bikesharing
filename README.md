When splitting the data in the graph by gender, the results show similar trends with almost all rides lasting less than 20 minutes. Men take more trips and for a longer duration overall then Women.

The heatmap above shows us that the peak times for citi bike rides are at 8am and 5-6pm on the weekdays, and on the weekends the trips are much more evenly split between the hours of the day.

This heatmap shows the peak times for each gender. While it is apparent that men have many more rides total, the times that the rides are being taken are roughly the same for both genders.

For this heatmap the data was further separated by user type. The maps show that most of the riders are male subscribers to the service.

## Summary

Based on all of the data visualizations presented, it makes the need for the bike sharing service to market itself towards females in the area, as there is a large discrepancy between the number of males riding regularly versus females. By providing more bike stations in the most popular starting and ending locations.

By utilizing the data shown in the maps above, representing the most common start and end locations throughout the city, it will be possible to maximize the number of users by increasing visibility and availability where neccessary.
